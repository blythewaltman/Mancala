---
An implementation of Mancala written in Python using the Django web framework. The game is hosted on Heroku [here](https://blythe-mancala.herokuapp.com/).

Two users can choose to play against eachother or a single user can play against an AI.

The AI was implemented using game trees, Minimax algorithm, and Alpha-beta pruning.
